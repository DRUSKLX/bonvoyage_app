# bonvoyage_app
An open source social media application for both mobile and desktop platforms, created with avid travellers in mind, allowing them to document their entire journey and share them with the world.

*My vision for this project is an app unlike any other, one which allows you to document your entire journey from beginning to end, airport to hotel, home to grandma's. And not only document but share...with the whole world and view other people's journeys, like them, make comments, give advice...all in one dedicated, powerful app.
